The meetings of core RDM community take place every month starting March 2020.
There is a shared google folder accessible to all members of the group. The agenda and the meeting notes are kept in this folder.
Lena Karvovskaya organizes each meeting by sending an outlook invitaiton to [the mailing list](https://listserver.vu.nl/mailman/listinfo/rdm-experts-network.ub)
For each meeting, the agenda is made open in advance. The way it has been structured until May 2020, the agenda leaves room for adding topics.
In April, the meeitng took place digitally. It was one hour instead of 1,5. The program was too packed for 1 hour. Lena is considerign restructuring the meetings so that there is a bit more room there.
The challenage is that participants have very different needs; while some only come to stay updated about the developments at VU, others have suggestions for collaboraiton and discussion.
Lena's approach until May was to have meetings satisfy the "update" goal and to organize additional meetings, sessions or even special interest groups when needed.
Topics for more detailed discussion include:
communication of RDM
Dataverse
Yoda
pseudonymization
tools like qualtrix, castor, etc...
