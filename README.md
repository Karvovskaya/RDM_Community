# RDM Community
:two_women_holding_hands:	I plan to work with people @VU Amsterdam, who deal with research data management (RDM). My goal is to connect them so that they succeed in helping researchers at the VU perform high-quality research. :two_men_holding_hands:

:computer:	We deliver shared value by sharing information, asking questions and helping each other find solutions in the areas of data management, FAIR principles, and research reproducibility.

:surfer: The broad goal of the RDM community is to shift the scholarly culture at the VU towards more transparent, reproducible research based on FAIR principles. Culture change has to be driven from the grassroots via initiatives supported at the top. Community
culture ensures a mix of top-down and bottom-up approaches; it drives up engagement and
makes people care about the shared values of the community.
