Community playbook framework:

1. *WHY*: why do we exist
2. *WHO*: who is involved. who is on the team, ambassadors, local leaders
3. *HOW*: 
    how is the programming done, how do we build a community
    how do we support and welcome people? (forms, CoC, welcome letter)
4. *WHERE*: only f2f? Twitter? Mailing list?
(communication channel analysis)
5. *WHAT*: if the community were successful, what would we see, what would be the changes of the world
6. *WHEN*: community roadmap **strategic plan** 


J Bacon:
The purpose of a **strategic plan** is to document your goals and ambitions for a given period of
time and to provide a central body of agreement in your organization or community. It should
clarify what your objectives are and which goals are part of those objectives; it should also state
how progress is measured and who is leading the work.
